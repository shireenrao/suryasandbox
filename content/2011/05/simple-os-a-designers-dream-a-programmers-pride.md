I would like an Operating System which is open source.  
Which has two options when its started for the first time.(Basic,
Advanced)  
Basic:my mother can use.Advanced: something a hardcore programmer hacker
can use  
which behaves like iPhoneOS/android i.e desktop with icons only(apps)/
no tray or task bar or menus or right clicks  
apps can do what ever they want.  
everything set to optimal default, plug and play, like boxee, xbmc (even
they are a little complicated/clunky)  
A single place to store documents,music,videos,settings,app store (with
repository can use windows,linux apps).  
A Closed App Ecosystem (only through repos like cydia)  
no need of c drive,program files.

should have good games and social apps to appeal masses  
In short, i want everything which iPad has and also the things it
lacks.(multitasking,flash,plugins etc)  
I guess future ChromeOS would be pretty close to what i want. There is
also Jolicloud
