Google, Apple, Microsoft... big names you get to hear about them almost
everyday and lot of flamewar going around with brand loyalty...like X
company blows or Y company is awesome\!\! For me its the products these
big names produce which i love and not the brand, i have macbookpro with
windows 7 installed and use google search and alternatively use bing. My
mouth waters if i see any cool innovative gadget/software which is a
game changer. For me i dont care if its closed or opensource as long as
its easy on the wallet (free is good too), easy to use and looks cool
and if there is competition it definitely helps
