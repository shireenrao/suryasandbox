Hello\! I recently changed from Drupal to Wordpress, Why? Cause, I was
hearing a lot of buzz and I had nothing better to do this weekend ^\_^.


I am happy i did, and my inital reaction is... Wordpress is made by
designers and Drupal is made by programmers. Why do i say this? 'Cause,
Wordpress  is a very user friendly and easy to manage application and at
the same time powerful too, for example you can extend it using plugins
and themes, especially themes. You can also make changes if you want.
where as Drupal is little complex and intimidating but very powerful and
extensible at the same time. Stick with it if you know your way around
it.
